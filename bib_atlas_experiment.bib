	Abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva is the world's newest and most powerful tool for Particle Physics research. It is designed to collide proton beams with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and an unprecedented luminosity of 10 34 cm −2 s −1 . It can also collide heavy (Pb) ions with an energy of 2.8 TeV per nucleon and a peak luminosity of 10 27 cm −2 s −1 . In this paper, the machine design is described.},
