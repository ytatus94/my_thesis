A search for the electroweak production of supersymmetric states with low \pt visible decay products is presented.
Events with significant \met and same flavor opposite charged lepton pairs are selected.
The minimum \pt of the lepton is 4.5~{\GeV} for the electrons and 4~{\GeV} for the muons.
The dilepton invariant mass and stranverse mass are the main discriminating variables used to construct signal regions.
This analysis is performed using LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~{\TeV} collected by the ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1~\ifb.
With no excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed, the results are interpreted using $R$-parity-conserving supersymmetry, where the produced states have small mass splitting with the lightest neutralino $\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$.
For the NUHM2 scenario, 95\% CL cross-section upper limits ranges between 11.5 and 3.8 $pb$ for $m_{1/2}$ values of 350 to 800~{\GeV} is provided.
