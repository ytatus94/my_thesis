I would like to thank everyone who have helped me.
%
Especially, thanks to my advisor Patrick Skubic, SS/3L+jets analysis convenor Ximo Poveda Torres, and post doctor Judita Mamu\v{z}i\'{c}.
%
Patrick gave me enough freedom and space to work on the project related to the analysis I was interesting in.
He guided me and gave me a lot of useful feedback when we discussed in the weekly meeting.
He also helped me to handle everything related to the university when I based at CERN for the past three years.

Ximo is a very good mentor and friend while I was at CERN.
He always taught me physics, helped me to solve the problems I met, and helped me to accommodate myself to the new life at CERN.
Without Ximo's great help, I couldn't finish my dissertation smoothly and successfully.
%
Judita kindly agreed to help me working on the NUHM2 interpretation in the Higgsino LSP research after I finished the study on the SS/3L+jets analysis.
Because she had many experiences about the NUHM2, she provided me many instructions about doing analysis and writing articles.
She also helped me to prepare the MC production, HiggsinoFitter scripts, and answered questions from the editorial board.
Without her fully supports, I cannot finish the NUHM2 study in a very short period.

Thanks to all my friends at CERN and OU for the good times we enjoyed together in exploring delicious food, traveling, hiking, bouldering, skiing, and boxing.
Thanks to my ex-girlfriend to warm my heart, to encourage me, and to love me, making me feel happiness in the first half of my Ph.D. life.
Thanks to my brother taking care of my parents when I am far away from Taiwan.
Finally, many thanks to my parents for everything they bestowed on me.
