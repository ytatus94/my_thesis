I would like to thank everyone who has helped me.
%
Especially, thanks to my advisor Patrick Skubic, SS/3L+jets analysis convenor Ximo Poveda Torres, and postdoc Judita Mamu\v{z}i\'{c}.
%
Patrick gave me enough freedom and space to work on projects related to the analysis I was interesting in.
He guided me and gave me a lot of useful feedback in the weekly meeting.
He also helped me handle everything related to the university when I based at CERN for the past three years.
%
Ximo is a very good mentor and friend while I was at CERN.
He always taught me physics, helped me to solve the problems I encountered, and helped me to acclimate myself to my new life at CERN.
Without Ximo's substantial help, I couldn't finish my dissertation smoothly and successfully.
%
Judita kindly agreed to help me work on the NUHM2 interpretation in the Higgsino LSP search after I finished the study on the SS/3L+jets analysis.
Because she had experience regarding the NUHM2 model, she provided me with assistance carrying out the analysis and writing documentation.
%She also helped me to prepare the MC production, HiggsinoFitter scripts, and answered questions from the editorial board.
Without her full support, I could not have finished the NUHM2 study in such a short period.

Thanks to all my friends at CERN and OU for the good times we enjoyed together in exploring delicious food, traveling, hiking, bouldering, skiing, and boxing.
Thanks to my ex-girlfriend to warm my heart, to encourage me, and to love me, making me feel happiness in the first half of my Ph.D. life.
Thanks to my brother for taking care of my parents while I am far away from Taiwan.
Finally, many thanks to my parents for everything they bestowed on me.

%I would like to deeply thank all of my teachers and professors over the 20 years of my academic journey, for instilling in me a deep, unquenchable desire to learn.
