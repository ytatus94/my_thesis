\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I wish to express my gratitude to my research advisor, Professor Noel Brady, for teaching me a great deal of mathematics,
for encouraging to explore and work in mathematics,  for his guidance and unconditional support during all these years of graduate school,
and for being a excellent mentor.  I am grateful for having had the opportunity to work with him.

I also wish to thank ....

In this thesis, we consider problems concerning .....

If $G$ is a countable group and $\mathcal{H}$ is a collection of subgroups of $G$, the notion of \emph{relative hyperbolicity} for the pair $(G, \mathcal{H})$  has been defined by
different authors ~\cite{BO99, DS05, Fa98, Gr87, GM06, HK08, Os06, Ya99}.  All these definitions are equivalent when ....

\begin{theorem}[S.M.\ Gersten \cite{Ge96} - B.\ Bowditch \cite{BO99} ] \label{thm:gersten_bowditch}
Let $H$ be a quasiconvex subgroup of a word-hyperbolic group $G$. Suppose $|gHg^{-1} \cap H |$ is finite whenever $g \not \in H$. Then $G$ is relatively hyperbolic with respect to $\Hs$.
