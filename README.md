  * remove `slides_for_defense.key` form master and commit this change
* Add `dissertation_check_1.pdf` and `dissertation_check_2.pdf` then commit this change
* Add `2018_Shen_Yu-Ting_Dissertation.tar.gz`
  * This is the tarball submit to SHAREOK as required by graduate college.
* Make tarball for `slides/YuTingShen_slides_for_defense.key` and `slides/slides_for_defense.key`
  * Add two tarballs to git and commit, and push to remote
