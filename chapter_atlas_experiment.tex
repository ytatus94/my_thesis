The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN\footnote{The name CERN is derived from the acronym for the French Conseil Europ\'{e}en pour la Recherch Nucl\'{e}aire}) was founded in 1954 and is based in the suburb of Geneva on the Franco\textendash Swiss border.
The main function of CERN is to provide particle accelerators and detectors for high-energy physics research.
The physicists and engineers at CERN are probing the fundamental structure of the universe using the world's largest and most complex scientific facility \textemdash \ the \textit{Large Hadron Collider} (LHC)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001}.
In the LHC, the particles are boosted to high energies and collide at close to the speed of light.
The results of the collisions are recorded by the various detectors.
There are seven experiments at the LHC.
The biggest of these experiments are \textit{ATLAS} (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003} and \textit{CMS} (Compact Muon Solenoid)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08004} which use general-purpose detectors to investigate a broad physics programme ranging from the search for the Higgs boson to extra dimensions and particles that could make up dark matter.
The \textit{ALICE} (A Large Ion Collider Experiment)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08002} experiment is designed to study the physics of quark-gluon plasma form and the \textit{LHCb} (Large Hadron Collider beauty)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08005} experiment specialises in investigating of CP violation\footnote{The CP violation is violation of the charge conjugate and parity symmetry which says if a particle is interchanged with its anti-particle and its spatial coordinates are inverted, then the physics laws should be the same.} by studying the $b$-quark.
These four detectors sit underground in huge caverns of the LHC ring.
The rest three experiments, \textit{TOTEM}~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08007}, \textit{LHCf}~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08006}, and \textit{MoEDAL}~\cite{Pinfold:1181486}, are smaller.
The TOTEM (TOTal Elastic and diffractive cross section Measurement)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08007} experiment aims at the measurement of total cross section, elastic scattering, and diffractive dissociation.
The LHCf (Large Hadron Collider forward)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08006} experiment is intended to measure the neutral particle produced by the collider using the forward particles.
The prime motivation of the MoEDAL (Monopole and Exotics Detector at the LHC)~\cite{Pinfold:1181486} experiment is to search directly for the magnetic monopole.

\section{The Large Hadron Collide}
\label{sec:ae_LHC}
The LHC~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001} is the world's largest and most powerful accelerator which accelerates and collides protons in a 26.7~km circumference crossing the Franco\textendash Swiss border 100~m underground.
Built in the tunnel of the former \textit{LEP} (Large Electron\textendash Positron), the LHC is capable of colliding protons as well as heavy ions.
Comparing with the LEP which collides electrons and positrons, the advantage of the LHC is the lower energy loss\footnote{The energy loss for protons is about eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the electrons} in the synchrotron radiation, such that higher energies can be reached by the LHC.
The LHC is designed for collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=14$~{\TeV} and an instantaneous luminosity of $\mathcal{L} =10^{34}~\textrm{cm}^{-2}\textrm{s}^{-1}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:ae_CERN_accelerator_complex} shows the infrastructure of the LHC and the pre-accelerator system.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{CERN's-accelerator-complex2013.jpg}
\caption{The accelerator complex at CERN~\cite{Marcastel:1621583}.}
\label{fig:ae_CERN_accelerator_complex}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The protons are extracted by ionisation from a hydrogen source and are accelerated to 50~{\MeV} by the linear accelerator \textit{LINAC2}.
Then they are injected into the \textit{Proton Synchrotron Booster} (PSB) where the proton energies are increased to 1.4~{\GeV} before they enter the \textit{Proton Synchrotron} (PS) which accelerates the protons to 25~{\GeV}.
Next, the proton energies are increasing to 450~{\GeV} in the \textit{Super Proton Synchrotron} (SPS). 
Finally, the protons are split into two beams and enter the LHC where the two beams run in two adjacent beam pipes with opposite directions.
In order to keep the protons on the circular trajectory in the LHC, 1232 superconducting dipole magnets~\cite{1288863} generate a magnetic field strength of 8.33~T to bend the proton beams in eight arcs.
Additionally, 392 quadrupole magnets~\cite{1288863} are installed to focus the beam.
A cryogenic system running with super-fluid helium-4 is used to cool down the superconducting magnets to a temperature of 1.7~K.

For a given physics process, the event rate is proportional to the cross section $\sigma$ of this process.
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt} = \mathcal{L}\cdot\sigma
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is the number of events and $\mathcal{L}$ denotes the luminosity of the beam.
The luminosity of the beam, $\mathcal{L}$, can be calculated by
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{N^{2} f}{4 \pi \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}} \cdot F
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is the number of protons, $f$ is the bunches crossing frequency, and the $\sigma_{x}$ and $\sigma_{y}$ are the $x$ and $y$ components for cross section $\sigma$.
The geometric luminosity reduction factor, $F$, is related to the crossing angle at the \textit{Interaction Point} (IP).
Considering a beam consisting of $1.15 \times 10^{11}$ protons with bunching spacing of 25~ns, the transversal size of the bunch at IP $16\times 10^{-4}$~cm, and taking the geometric luminosity reduction factor as 1, the design luminosity of $10^{34}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ can be reached.

The first beam was circulated through the collider on the morning of 10 September 2008~\cite{CERN-COURIER-Sep192008}.
However, a magnet quench incident occurred on 19 September 2008 and caused extensive damage to over 50 superconducting magnets, their mountings, and the vacuum pipe.
Most of 2009 was spent on repairs the damage caused by the magnet quench incident and the operations resumed on 20 November of that year.
The first phase of data-taking (Run 1) started at the end of 2009 and the beam energy was increased to a centre-of-mass $\sqrt{s}=7$~{\TeV} in 2011 and $\sqrt{s} = 8$~{\TeV} in 2012.
The total integrated luminosity of 5.46~{\ifb} was collected in 2011 and of 22.8~{\ifb} was collected in 2012.
Since 13 February 2013 the LHC was in the Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) phase for maintenance and upgrades.
On 5 April 2015, the LHC restarted and was operating at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$~{\TeV} throughout the Run 2 phase\footnote{The Run 2 data-taking started from 2015}.

\section{The ATLAS experiment}
\label{sec:ae_ATLAS}
The ATLAS\footnote{A Toroidal LHC Apparatus} detector~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003} is a multi-purpose detector housed in its cavern at point 1 at the LHC~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001}.
It is the largest experiment at the LHC with a length of 44~m, a diameter of 25~m, and a weight of approximately 7000 tonnes.
It consists of three high precision sub-detector systems which are arranged concentrically around the interaction point and in forward and backward symmetrically.
Related to this symmetry, the ATLAS detector is sectioned into the central barrel region with one end-cap region perpendicular to the beam pipe on either side.
Figure~\ref{fig:ae_ATLAS_detector} shows an overview of the ATLAS detector with its major components.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{0803012_01-A4-at-144-dpi.jpg}
\caption{Overview of the ATLAS detector~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003}.}
\label{fig:ae_ATLAS_detector}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The ATLAS detector is designed to record the proton-proton interactions delivered by the LHC.
It can identify particles and measure their tracks and energies with very high precision, therefore, it is sensitive to large areas of particle physics phenomena from the precision measurement of the  Standard Model to beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
The detector is constituted by three sub-detector systems and the magnet system.
The innermost part of the detector is called the \textit{inner detector} which identifies and reconstructs the charged particles as well as the primary and secondary vertices.
Around it, the \textit{calorimeter} system is built as a cylindrical barrel with caps at each end to measure the particle energies.
The detector is completed by the \textit{muon spectrometer} which performs identification and measurement of momenta of muons.
The magnetic system produces a field of $B$ = 0.5~T and $B$ = 1~T at barrel and two end-cap, respectively.
The detector has to withstand large collision rates with approximately 1000 particles per collision, therefore, a fast readout and a three-level trigger system are implemented to reduce the event rate from 40~MHz to 200~Hz.
The ATLAS coordinate system and the detail of each sub-detector systems are described in the following sections.

%%%
%%%
%%%

\subsection{The ATLAS coordinate system}
\label{subsec:ae_atlas_coordinate}
ATLAS uses a \textit{right-handed coordinate system} with its origin at the nominal proton-proton interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the $z$-axis along the beam pipe.
Along the $z$-axis the detector is divided into side-A (positive $z$) and side-C (negative $z$).
The positive $x$-axis is defined by the direction pointing from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, and the positive $y$-axis points upward.%Cylindrical coordinates $(r, \phi)$ are used in the transverse plane.
The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured around the beam pipe  and the polar angle $\theta$ is the angle from the $z$-axis.
The transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, the transverse energy $E_{\mathrm{T}}$ and the missing transverse
energy $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ are defined in the transverse plane\footnote{$x-y$ plane}, here exemplary for $p_{\mathrm{T}}$:
%
\begin{equation}
p_{\mathrm{T}}= \sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2}}
\end{equation}
%
An important quantity in hadron collider physics is the \textit{rapidity}, $y$, because of the invariance $y$ under Lorentz boosts in the longitudinal direction.
The rapidity is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
y = \frac{1}{2} \ln\Big[\frac{E + p_{z}}{E - p_{z}}\Big]
\end{equation}
%
where $E$ denotes the particle energy and $p_{z}$  is the component of the momentum along the beam direction.
Since mainly leptons can be considered massless in respect to the nominal centre-of-mass energy, the pseudorapidity, $\eta$, is used in stead of using the $y$.
For a massless particle, the \textit{pseudorapidity}, $\eta$, depends on the polar angle $\theta$ through:
%
\begin{equation}
\eta = - \ln \tan \frac{\theta}{2}
\end{equation}
%
For a particle with the energy $E$ much larger than its mass, the approximation $E \approx |\vec{p}|$ is valid.
The distance, $\Delta R$, between two objects in the $\eta-\phi$ plan is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta \eta^{2} + \Delta \phi^{2}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \phi$ are the difference in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle, respectively.

\subsection{The Inner Detector and Tracking System}
\label{subsec:ae_inner_detector}
The \textit{inner detector} (ID) consists of three sub-detectors: the \textit{Pixel} detector, the \textit{Semi Conductor Tracker}  (SCT), and the \textit{Transition Radiation Tracker} (TRT).
The main purpose of the inner detector is to provide high precision measurements of the tracks of particles and to reconstruct the primary and secondary vertices.
Each sub-detectors are composed of several layers of material which interacts with the charged particles when the charged particles penetrate the layers.
A  2~T magnetic field generated by the central solenoid parallel to the beam axis is applied to bend the charged particles using the Lorentz force.
By using the radius $r$ of the curvature of the tracks, the magnetic field strength $B$, and the charge of the particle $q$, we can calculate the magnitude of the transverse momentum \pt:
%
\begin{equation}
\pt = |q|Br
\end{equation}
%
The layout of the inner detector is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ae_inner_detector} and the detail of sub-detectors are described in the following paragraphs.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:ae_inner_detector}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%%%
%%%
%%%

\subsubsection{Pixel Detector}
\label{subsubsec:ae_pixel}
The innermost part of the entire ATLAS detector components is the \textit{Pixel} detector which is composed of three barrel layers and three end-cap disks on each side.
The three cylindrical barrel layers around the beam axis have radial positions of 50.5~mm, 88.5~mm, and 122.5~mm respectively and they are made of 22, 38, and 52 identical staves respectively.
Each stave is inclined with azimuthal angle of 20 degrees and is composed of 13 pixel modules with 46,080 readout channel per module.
The size of each pixel is $50 \times 400~\mu m^{2}$ in $R-\phi \times z$.
In the forward region, three disks on each side equip the modules identical to the barrel modules, except the connecting cables. 
The total 1,744 modules in the pixel detector lead to nearly 80 million channel readout and provide the intrinsic accuracies of $10~\mu m$ in $R-\phi$ plane and $115~\mu m$ in $z$ direction covering the region $|\eta| < 2.5$. 

%%%
%%%
%%%

\subsubsection{Semi Conductor Tracker}
\label{subsubsec:ae_sct}
On the top of the pixel detector is the \textit{Semi Conductor Tracker} (SCT) which is a silicon strip detector.
There are about 6.3 million readout channels which are arranged in 4088 microstrips.
The intrinsic accuracies per sensor is $17~\mu m$ in $R-\phi$ and $580~\mu m$ in $z$ direction for the barrel and in $R$ for the  disks, respectively.
Similar to the pixel detector, the SCT covers the region $|\eta| < 2.5$ and consists of 8 strip layers in barrel and a total of 9 discs in the end-cap region on each side.
No track reconstruction is possible beyond the covered pseudorapidity range.
Therefore, the electrons cannot be distinguished from photons above $|\eta| > 2.5$ region.

%%%
%%%
%%%

\subsubsection{Transition Radiation Tracker}
\label{subsubsec:ae_trt}
The outermost component of the inner detector is the \textit{Transition Radiation Tracker} (TRT) which consists of 4~mm diameter straw tubes filled with the xenon-based gas mixture.
The gas mixture are ionised by charged particles when they penetrates the straws.
The ionised electrons drift to the cathode because a high voltage is applied on the tungsten wire in the center of the straw tube.
Therefore, the TRT allows the enhanced electron identification, momentum measurement, vertex measurement.
In the barrel region, the straws are surrounded by polypropylene fibres and are divided into two halves at $|\eta|=0$.
In the end-caps, the straws are arranged radially and surrounded by foils as a transition radiation element.
They are read out at two sides and at the center of the TRT with the total number of the readout channels of TRT are approximately 350,000.
The TRT only provides information in the $R-\phi$ plane with an intrinsic accuracy of 130~$\mu$m per straw and covers a range up to $|\eta| < 2.0$. 

%%%
%%%
%%%

\subsubsection{Solenoid Magnet}
\label{subsubsec:ae_magnetic}
A superconducting solenoid magnet encloses the inner detector and produces a 2~T magnetic field to bend the trajectories of the charged particles.
A cooling system is used and shared with the \textit{electromagnetic calorimeter} (Section~\ref{subsec:ae_calorimeter}) to reduced the deterioration of the energy measurement.

%%%
%%%
%%%

\subsection{The Calorimeters}
\label{subsec:ae_calorimeter}
The calorimeters are used to measure the energy of particles, such as electrons, photons, and jets.
Besides muons and neutrinos, all other particles interacting electromagnetically or hadronically are stopped in the calorimeters by absorbing their energy.
Not only charged particles but also neutral particles such as photons and neutral hadrons can be detected in the calorimeters.
By requiring highly hermiticity of the calorimeters, the missing energy \met can be reconstructed precisely as negative vectorial sum of all energy deposits.
The ATLAS calorimeter system is placed between the Inner Detector (Section~\ref{subsec:ae_inner_detector}) and the Muon Spectrometer (Section~\ref{subsec:ae_the_muon_spectrometer}).
The ATLAS calorimeter system consists of an inner \textit{Electromagnetic Calorimeter} and an outer \textit{Hadronic Calorimeter} together with the \textit{Forward Calorimeter}.
The Electromagnetic Calorimeter and Hadronic Calorimeter are \textit{sampling calorimeters} which consist of two different materials alternately.
An absorber material is used to enhance the particle showers\footnote{The shower is the cascade of secondary particles produced by the high-energy particle interacting with dense material.} and a highly ionisable active medium is used to measure the deposited energy.
Because only the energies deposited in the active medium can be observed, the total energy of the shower can be estimated from the deposited energy by clustering algorithms.
The Electromagnetic Calorimeter is focusing on measuring electrons and photons, and the Hadronic Calorimeter is dedicated for hadronically interacting particles.
The whole ATLAS calorimeter system covers a range $|\eta| < 4.9$.
An layout view of the ATLAS calorimeter system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ae_calorimeter} and the detail of the three calorimeters are described in the following paragraphs.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

*****
Besides in the barrel region of the hadronic calorimeter, which consists of scintillation tiles, liquid argon (LAr) is used as the sensitive medium.  Since the total absorption of high-energy particles must be guaranteed the thickness plays an important role in the design of a calorimeter.
This is specified in radiation or interaction lengths, X0 and λ, respectively6. 
The total thickness of the whole active calorimeter is λ = 9.7 at η = 0. 
%This sufficiently prevents high-energetic particles to penetrate to the Muon Spectrometer while adequately letting pass muons.

The EM objects produce narrow calorimeter showers while hadrons tend to produce wider showers.
%Each particle traversing the calorimeter deposit energy in the adjacent calorimeter cells along its path. 
%To measure the total energy deposited by each of these particles, calorimeter cells from all subdetectors are combined using different algorithms known as clustering.

It consists of electromagnetic liquid Argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter covering |η| < 3.2 and hadronic tile scintillator calorimeter in the barrel region covering |η| < 1.7, with the end-caps made in LAr technology, covering the remaining 1.5 < |η| < 3.2 range. 
To improve the pseudorapidity coverage the LAr forward calorimeters have been put in place up to the |η| < 4.9 region. 
The depth of the calorimeters has been calculated in such a way that they have a good coverage for electromagnetic and hadronic showers, but also need to be absorbent enough to prevent punch through of these objects to the muon detector. 
The barrel and end-cap region of the electromagnetic LAr detector with its fine granularity is used together with the tracking system for precision electron and photon measurements. 
The outer smaller granularity of the hadronic detector is well suited for jet reconstruction and measurements of Emiss.


The ATLAS calorimeter is divided into an electromagnetic calorimeter based on liquid argon (LAr) and a hadronic calorimeter based on iron-scintillator “tiles”(Tile). 
%The distinction is due to the different interaction behaviour between the calorimeter and electrons/photons on one side and hadrons on the other side. [12].
%An overview of the calorimeter system can be seen in Figure 3.8. 
Overall they cover solid angles up to |η| ă 4.9, with the electromagnetic calorimetry providing finer grained measurements to augment the inner detector for electron and photon measurements, while the hadronic calorimeter is coarser but sufficient for jet reconstruction and measurements of missing transverse momentum.
%The ATLAS calorimeters are sampling calorimeters. 
%Incident particles produce showers of energy in the calorimeter. 
%Only a fraction of the energy produced by the particle is measured by active detector sensors.
%The energy of the full shower can be inferred from the observed energy.
%Thus a calibration must be used to estimate the true energy of any observed shower in the calorimeter.
%Each calorimeter is also segmented in η and φ to provide some directional information, although it is coarser than that from the inner detector. 
%Finally, the calorimeter is designed to limit “punch-through” of high energy jets into the muon chambers.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
\label{subsubsec:ae_ecal}
The \textit{Electromagnetic Calorimeter} (ECAL) measures the energy of electrons and photons as they interact with matter.
The ECAL consists of accordion shaped cells of alternating layers of lead as absorber material and liquid argon (LAr) as active medium.
The accordion shaped provides the full coverage in the azimuthal angle $\phi$.
The LAr is chosen as an active medium because it is hard to radiate, it has stable response time and linear behaviour~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003}.
The electrons or photons lose their energies by alternating bremsstrahlung and pair production when they interact with lead and result in the electromagnetic particle showers which ionise the LAr and the ionisation currents are collected by the copper electrodes.
The ECAL is divided into barrel (EMB) and end-cap (EMEC) components, which cover $|\eta| < 1.475$ and $1.375 < |\eta| < 3.2$\footnote{There are two EMECs and each of them consists of two wheels. The inner wheel covers $1.375 < |\eta| < 2.5$ and the outer wheel covers $2.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$}, respectively.
The EMB is made up of three longitudinal layers with different granularity and sensitive in the region $|\eta| < 2.5$.
The first strip layer has the highest granularity where the size of cells corresponding to $\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.0031 \times 0.1$ for $|\eta| < 1.8$ and coarser for larger $|\eta|$.
The smallest granularity allows to separate the showers coming from electrons, photons and neutral pions.
The second layer is the largest part of the EMB with the size of cells corresponding to $\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.025 \times 0.0245$ so most of the energies are deposited in this layer.
The third layer has the granularity $\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.05 \times 0.0245$.
The total thickness are 22~$X_{0}$\footnote{The $X_{0}$ stands for radiation lengths which is a characteristic of material. It is related to the energy loss of the particle when it interacts with the material electromagnetically.} and 24~$X_{0}$ for EMB and EMECs, respectively.
This special thickness is sufficient to prevent the punch-throughs of high energy showers into the Muon Spectrometer.
Figure~\ref{fig:ae_ecal} shows the cut-away view of the the accordion shaped EMB module with the dimensions for three layers.

\subsubsection{Hadronic Calorimeter}
\label{subsubsec:ae_hcal}










%Hadrons, which are significantly heavier and mainly interact via the strong force, propagate further causing more wide-spread hadronic showers mainly in the denser Hadronic Calorimeter.

%Hadronic showers usually penetrate the material further and partly shower in the consec- utive hadronic calorimeter, that surrounds the electromagnetic calorimeter. The ATLAS hadronic calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter, too. In the barrel region it is made of steel absorbers and scintillating tiles. In the end-caps it consists of two independent wheels per end-cap of copper plates, that are interleaved with liquid-argon gaps.


%The hadronic calorimeter consists of a tile calorimeter in the barrel, a liquid-Argon calorimeter in the hadronic end-cap (HEC) and a liquid-Argon forward calorimeter. In the tile calorimeter steel is used as absorber and scintillator as active medium. It is subdivided into a central and two extended barrels and covers |η| < 1.7. The light generated in the scintillator is read-out via wavelength shifting fibers. The HEC is a copper LAr sampling calorimeter composed of two cylindrical wheels in the range 1.5 < |η| < 3.2 as illustrated in Figure 3.7. The two hadronic
%FCAL modules (FCAL2 and FCAL3) are mainly made of Tungsten serving as the absorber material to minimize the lateral spread of hadronic showers, again with LAr as the sensitive medium in the gaps between the rods and the tubes.

%Behind the ECAL the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) is equipped. Its purpose is to determine the energy of hadronically interacting particles, like charged pions from tau decays. Therefore, it is composed of three sub-systems. The tile barrel is a sampling calorimeter with steel absorbers and plastic scintillators as active material. It covers a range of |η| < 1.7 and extends up to 9.7 hadronic interaction lengths in the transverse central region. Thus, a high energy resolution is gained and a punch through to the muon system is significantly suppressed. If a particle traverses the detector a hadronic shower is formed which involves an electromagnetic component. The produced secondary particles then stimulate the scintillating material. The emitted relaxation light is collected by photo multiplier tubes (PMTs) via wavelength shifters to increase the efficiency. The measured signal is proportional to the deposited energy. A pseudorapidity range of |η| = ±(1.5 − 3.2) is covered by the hadronic end-cap, and thus it overlaps with the tile barrel. To cope with the higher radiation densities liquid argon and copper are arranged in a sandwich structure. The third device, the forward calorimeter (FCAL), is the closest to the beam pipe, extending over a range of 3.1 < |η| < 4.9. It is composed of one copper layer to measure electromagnetic interactions, and two tungsten layers for hadronically interacting particles. Longitudinal channels with grounded tubes and high voltage-fed rods are distributed over each layer. The 0.25-0.5 mm wide gaps are filled with liquid argon, thus the same physical principle as by the ECAL is exploited.

%The hadronic calorimeter is subdivided into three components. The barrel and
%738 the endcap (HEC) covers a pseudorapidity range of |η| < 1.7 and 1.5 < |η| < 3.2,
%739 respectively. The very forward region, 3.1 < |η| < 4.9, is covered by the forward
%740 calorimeter (FCal). The barrel region uses steel as the absorber material and
%741 scintillating tiles as the active material. The HEC and the FCal uses LAr as the
%742 active material but for the absorber material, the HEC uses copper, while the FCal
%743 uses both copper and tungsten. In order to reduce the punch-through into the muon
%system, the nuclear interaction length 3 (λ) of the hadronic calorimeter is typically
%745 ∼10.
%746 Each particle traversing the calorimeter deposit energy in the adjacent calorimeter
%747 cells along its path. To measure the total energy deposited by each of these particles,
%748 calorimeter cells from all subdetectors are combined using different algorithms known
%749 as clustering.

%The tile calorimeter is the hadron calorimeter covering the range of |η| ă 1.7. The tile calorimeter uses steel tiles as an absorber and scintillating tiles as the detector. The scintillator tile calorimeter is separated into a barrel and two extended barrel cylinders. The light produced in the scintillators is read out with wavelength-shifting optical fibers to photomultipliers (PMTs) placed on the outside of the calorimeter.

\subsubsection{Forward Calorimeter}
\label{subsubsec:ae_fcal}




%while the FCAL is in the very forward region with 3.1 < |η| < 4.9. 

%The forward region is covered by the Forward Calorimeter (FCAL) in the pseudo-rapidity
%range of 3.1 < |η| < 4.9. As already mentioned, electrons outside the acceptance of the
%tracking system are not discussed in this analysis. With regard to this analysis, the
%forward calorimeter contributes to the measurement of the missing transverse energy
%Emiss. The FCAL is, again, a liquid argon sampling calorimeter consisting of three T
%layers, the first with copper, the other two with tungsten as the absorber material.

%The three layered forward calorimeter (FCAL) close to the beam pipe consists of a copper and Tungsten matrix filled with concentric rods and tubes with LAr in the gaps. Only the first wheel (FCAL1) is an electromagnetic module with copper as the absorber.

\subsection{The Muon Spectrometer}
\label{subsec:ae_the_muon_spectrometer}
The outermost part of the ATLAS detector is the \textit{Muon Spectrometer}~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003,Palestini:681459,Diehl:2009bw}.
Muons have the same properties as electrons but 200 times heavier than the electrons and muons don't interact predominately by Bremsstrahlung but have minimal ionising at LHC energy in the inner layers of the detector.
Only the muons with an energy less than 5~{\GeV} are stopped before the Muon Spectrometer.
Therefore, muons are the only measurable particles that can penetrate the Inner Detector and the Calorimeters.
In order to determine the muon momentum with high precision, a detector that concentrates on the measurement of muons is necessary.

The Muon Spectrometer is designed to measure the transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) of muons with $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 3$~{\GeV} with a resolution of 3\% for $p_{\mathrm{T}} < 250$~{\GeV} and increasing to 10\% at 1~{\TeV}.
It consists of large toroid magnets system and three layers of high precision tracking chambers which allow a precise measurement of the muon momentum over nearly the full solid angle.
The barrel toroid magnet system is composed of eight superconducting coils which are installed radial symmetrically around the beam pipe.
It covers the range $|\eta| < 1.4$ and bends the trajectories of muons with the bending power 1.5 to 5.5 Tm.
The magnetic field produced by the barrel toroid magnets provides an approximately 1~T field at the center of each coils, but is rather non-uniform, especially in the barrel-endcap transition region.
In the endcap toroid magnets system, the magnetic field is provided by eight superconducting coils, closed in an insulation vessel extending to about 10 m in diameter, located between the first and the second station of tracking chambers.
The endcap toroid magnets cover $1.6 < |\eta| < 2.4$ and provide a a magnetic field in the range of 1 to 2 T with bending power 1 to 7.5 Tm.

The \textit{Monitored Drift Tubes} (MDTs) consists of cylindrical drift tubes, filled with a gas mixture of argon and carbon dioxide.
A tungsten-rhenium alloyed aluminium wire in the centre of each tube collects the electrons freed by ionisation of the gas volume by traversing muons.
The MDTs covers a full range of $|\eta| < 2.7$, while the inner layer only covers $|\eta| < 2.0$.
The Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) provides a coverage range $2.0 < |\eta| < 2.7$, where MDTs would have occupancy problems.
Both MDTs and CSCs are used for precision tracking in the spectrometer bending plane and end-cap inner layer, respectively.
The Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) and Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs) are used for triggering in barrel and end-cap, they have sufficient intrinsic time resolution of 1.5 ns and 4 ns, respectively.
A sketch of the Muon Spectrometer and its four components are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:ae_muon_spectrometer} and Table~\ref{tab:ae_muon_spectrometer_components} gives a summary of the Muon Spectrometer components
